I decided to give it a go. I went through three rounds of screening- a basic assessment, followed by a group discussion and 1:1 interview with the HR team of the IT company. ",

Mobile tech was still in its nascent stages back in 2010, and Aspire helped me pick up this specialty that became a hot skill in time.
